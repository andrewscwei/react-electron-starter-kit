## TL;DR

Install project dependencies and launch a dev instance locally:

$ npm run dev

## Production Logging

By default, logs are written to the following locations:

- on Linux: `~/.config/{app name}/logs/{process type}.log`
- on OS X: `~/Library/Logs/{app name}/{process type}.log`
- on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\{app name}\logs\{process type}.log`
